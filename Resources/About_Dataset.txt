Two datasets (house price and deprivation dataset) used in building our model were obtained from the data repository of the Office of National Statistics, United Kingdom (ONS, UK). The datasets were downloaded as comma-delimited (CSV) files from the ONS repository.
The house price dataset contains the median house prices of each Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) region in England for the period of 1999 to 2021.The Deprivation dataset contained indices that measure the deprivation of these Lower-layer Super Output Areas across several domains of deprivation as shown in the table below. These domains represent the independent variables or features used in this analysis.
